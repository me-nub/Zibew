MS Dhoni often referred as captain cool ! Yes probably the best captain India has produced for International cricket. In short words, Dhoni can be described as captain with long term visibility, logic, sharpness in real time cricket and his cool mentality. Staying clam and not taking burden even in high pressure matches. Yes, Dhoni has made few wrong decisions especially in tosses where India has lost in Finals of many tournaments, but overall you can rate him as the best captain which India as seen in recent times. Virat Kholi recently is been compared better than Dhoni but in my view its too early to comment on Virat Kohli’s captaincy.
